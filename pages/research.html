                    Making this website wasn't easy I had to do intensive research to
                    make this website. Every thing from the over theme to a simple card
                    that displays an email were inspired from various website. I gave
                    them my own touch ofcourse, but nevertheless this website wasnt
                    possible without research. Not only I was able to make this website
                    for my course work but I saw some great functionalities and features
                    that immensly improve the quality of a product.

                        Brad Traversy is an online tutor who makes tutorial videos on different web technologies and programming. I too have
                        been following him for a long time, so I went through his website for inspiration. I liked his header as it was simple
                        and intuitive. On the other hand, it matched my website theme as well. In contrast to his website, my website uses the
                        current web page's name rather than the website's logo. and the links are more spread apart.

                    <p class="about">
                        the contact section on the Traversy Media's website caught my eye too
                        . I liked the way he
                        presented his email in a card which looks like a visiting
                        card. This felt as if he has incorporated a real world
                        element into his website, because of which I decided to
                        do something similar in my website too, but insted of giving just
                        my email. I used this to present an alternative to the
                        contact form used in my website. Unlike Brad Traversy's
                        website my email card does not stand out from the background.
                        However it does contain a @ symbol because its common to
                        use this symbol to symbolize email address and contacts

                    <p class="about">
                        I came across Jan Baszczok's website while I was researching
                        for this course work. the name of his website is YASI0. 
                        The thing that intrigued me the most was his introduction. It
                        was concise and introduced someone who is in IT. on the other hand
                        it had an animation that gave off his skills and abilities.
                        I incorporated this feature in my website by introducing
                        myself and adding a javascript that would change the content
                        under the "I am a" section. The background of the banner
                        has a striped pattern and instead of the animation used
                        in the referenced website the text change without an
                        animation

                        to the style of the footer in The Conversation Media's website.
                        Most of the contents of the footer like social media and

                        The Harrisburg Web Design & Squarespace Developer belongs 
                        to Devon Stank,
                        He is a web developer. His website was the main inspiration 
                        for the theme,
                        color scheme, and fonts used in my website. I wasn't going 
                        to use just black and white on my website. it was going to
                        contain
                        lots of color like red and blue, but after visiting Devon 
                        Stank's website
                        I came to realize that using a lot of designs and color 
                        distracts the visitor. That is why I decided to keep my website
                        as minimal as possible with a simple color pallet.

                        Gizmodo is a website that contains articles about different
                        stuff related to technology and science. I was reading some 
                        articles on this website and got an inspiration for styling
                        my blog. The style used u=in the heading is particularly 
                        based on the style used in Gizmodo's articles. on the other
                        hand,
                        the share buttons are on the bottom and the article is contained 
                        inside a container which is then aligned to the center.

                        The button styling on the home page was inspired by the
                        the search bar on Google's Homepage.
                        this is a simple style that adds some uniqueness to the
                        webpage. the slight hover effect achieved by applying shadow
                        , to achieve this I applied a lighter shadow to the buttons
                        initially and when the mouse hovers over it the offset and the
                        the spread of the shadow increases to give an illusion of the
                        button being lifted and the shadow gets darker, to make
                        everything smooth transition was used. the gradient of
                        color from the top left to the bottom right was used to
                        simulate lighting shone from the top right
