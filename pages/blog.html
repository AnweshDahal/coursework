                    Technology is the set of tools, gadgets, and techniques that 
                    are developed upon our knowledge and understanding of the
                    world. These tools help us to make our work easier and more 
                    efficient. Perhaps one of the most important forms of
                    technology in today’s world is the Internet. Internet is a 
                    decentralized connection of millions of systems that are
                    spread throughout the world and provide information and services 
                    to its users on a massive scale; therefore we can say
                    that it is a network of networks. The Internet has become a 
                    staple of modern lifestyle; most of our daily activities are
                    in some way related to the internet and the services it provides, 
                    either directly or indirectly. Internet’s sole purpose
                    is to provide the user with the information they require, this 
                    information can be directions to their work, the music
                    they want to listen to, or the research materials they want to look at.

                    The Internet has provided a huge platform for talent and knowledge 
                    to grow upon. However, the positive aspects of the
                    internet aren’t limited to its immense contribution to education. 
                    Communication is something that has had an even bigger
                    impact of internet technology. People use the internet to 
                    communicate all the time because this form of communication is
                    faster, cheaper, and more versatile. Emails have almost replaced 
                    snail mails, even though people use Internet Relay Chat
                    (IRC) more than they use emails. Emails are more preferable 
                    in a formal work or educational environment. People can
                    conduct conferences and meetings with their peers across the 
                    globe without leaving their room, this is called video
                    conference which is also informally referred to as video chat. 
                    The internet has also provided an alternative for voice
                    calls; this enables the user to make calls to our peers cheaper.

                    The Internet has helped a lot of people to flourish their businesses 
                    too. As e-commerce is growing rapidly and becoming more preferable 
                    among the people. Small business owners get a chance to sell 
                    their products and services to a larger number of customers.

                    The most important contribution made by the internet is to 
                    education and research. Students and researchers can get
                    access to this immense resource of information and study materials 
                    on the click of a button. Studying through the
                    internet doesn’t just save money that would be spent on buying 
                    books or library membership but also provides the most up
                    to date and relevant content. In a world where technology develops 
                    at an extremely fast rate, using outdated information
                    isn’t beneficial or rewarding. On the other hand, people don’t 
                    have to spend a big sum of money to learn something new.
                    There are a lot of people who post instructional videos on the 
                    internet that teach the same thing at a much cheaper rate
                    or sometimes even for free also people can schedule their learning 
                    time according to their existing time table. This
                    makes online tutorials more preferable for students and busy 
                    people.

                    Just like everything the internet also has some negative aspects. 
                    Since the Internet provides some level of anonymity to
                    its users, so some people use this anonymity with malicious 
                    intent. Harassment and cyberbullying have become a common
                    problem for a lot of people on the internet. People tend to 
                    harass and bully the people whom they don’t agree with or
                    the people they don’t like. In addition to this, some people 
                    use the internet to spread false news and misinformation,
                    just to promote their ideas and views either political or personal. 
                    This news easily affects the people who aren’t
                    informed or educated enough on those topics and get influenced 
                    by them.
                </p>
                <p class = "articleContent">
                    Another major harmful activity conducted on the internet is 
                    phishing. <a href="https://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing" style="color: #002fff; font-weight: bold;">
                    Phishing.org</a> defines phishing as, a 
                    cybercrime where a target is approached by the attacker disguised 
                    in the form of a legitimate and trustworthy figure to obtain
                    their sensitive information like identity, and banking or credit 
                    card information. This information is then used to
                    cause harm to the victim in the form of identity theft or financial 
                    loss.
                </p>
                <p class = "articleContent">
                    The internet is also used to spread computer viruses or malware. 
                    According to <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-computer-virus.html" style="color: #002fff; font-weight: bold;">
                    Norton</a>, a computer virus is a malicious
                    program that can replicate itself much like a real virus and spread 
                    from hosts (system) to hosts and harm them. A
                    computer virus is the biggest threat faced by users of the internet. 
                    The sole purpose of a computer virus is to cause harm to the victim. 
                    Along with this, there are other forms of malicious programs 
                    that are spread via the internet like spyware or ransomware.
                </p>
                <p class = "articleContent">
                    The Internet can also get addictive since the internet is filled 
                    with entertaining resources and contents people may spend hours 
                    surfing the web and care less about their personal health, hygiene 
                    and the people close to them.
                </p>
                <p class="articleContent">
                    However, the effects that the Internet will have on a person’s 
                    life depend upon the way he/she uses the internet.
                    Misusing anything will certainly cause some harm and this applies 
                    to the internet as well. In my point of view, the
                    internet is beneficial as long as it’s used ethically. I use 
                    the internet for a wide range of activities like learning a
                    new language, to learn programming, streaming movies, reading 
                    articles or just know what the weather will be like that
                    day. I believe that if the users are careful and cautious while 
                    using the internet they will experience little to no
                    negative aspects of the internet. The internet provides a lot 
                    of facilities that when used responsibly can benefit the
                    user in lots of ways.
                </p>
                <p class="articleContent">
                    In conclusion, the internet has both good and bad sides. It 
                    has connected people regardless of the place they live in.
                    People get to know the thing that is happening in the world 
                    at the click of a button. Our lives have become easier
                    because if we desire we can do a wide range of activities without 
                    leaving our homes. Art and culture can be promoted
                    easily. Students don’t have to depend upon their classes to 
                    learn new things. However, we can also see an increase in
                    harassment, illegal and bad activities that agitate not only 
                    the victim but the society as well. Finally, the experience
                    we get using internet technology or the effects it will have 
                    on our lives will depend entirely on the way we used it.
